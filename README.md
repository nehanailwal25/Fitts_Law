1.	Experimental Design:

The design consists of some buttons to perform fitt’s law experiment. The buttons are of3 different sizes and were away from the starting point at 3 different values.
Experiment starts with a screen asking the user if he/she wants to start with a Finger:
 
And as soon as the user presses this button the disabled target button becomes clickable as a target.
And then again a new red colored start button will appear as soon as the user clicks on it the next target becomes  clickable and the time is noted down after every step.
Whenever user will click on the start button a new button at a certain distance (Amplitude) will be created with a certain width.
 
Meanwhile if any button was missed by the user that will be recorded and the input will be asked again from the user (to make them a total of 90 successful trials)
After all the 90 trials by Finger will be completed successfully by the user, then a new screen with a button asking to “Start for Thumb” will be there:
 
The same procedure will start but this time user will be using their thumb.
 
Same procedure for recording the errors is implemented here as well.
Again, after the 90 successful runs a new button saying “Share” will be there, with the help of this the generated CSV from the app will be saved in device/ shared via mail or any other resource available by the name “data.csv”.
 
 

That’s how we are getting the data from the app and later this data was analyzed and equations of MT for both devices were found out as needed.

2.	Equations for MT for both devices:

           MT (Thumb) = 156.25 + 105.57 ID  and  R² = 0.9679
           MT (Finger) = 115.03 + 107.71 ID  and  R² = 0.8977
